**This project is about Writing a Script to report the usage of AWS resources in a project**

*Basic understanding*
<small>Why does any company moves to cloud infrastructure it is because of two primary reasons:</small>
1. Manageability: We need to maintain our own data centers and need to do upgradation of servers and we need dedicated team to maintain them.
2. Cost: As these resources are pay as you go but the physical infrasturcture is you need to pay for it as it is present in
   data center.

**Business scenario**: 
Suppose we have 10 developers and organization has given access to all of them to create servers on AWS and they have created EC2'S but most of them is unused still AWS bills for it as you have created them so main goal of moving to cloud is to be cost effective so as a devops engineer its primary responsibility to maintain the cost effiectiveness so we need to track the resource usage.
