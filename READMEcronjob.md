#So lets develop a shell scripting for tracking the aws resource usage, lets say an organization is using EC2,S3, Lambda functions so everyday at a 10 AM (certain time) we need to provide this information to a manager stating how many are active through a file so every day you need to run the script manually by login into aws and if you are not available it will be missed so we intergrate this script with cronjob in linux so at that certain time it automatically executes the shell script.so
